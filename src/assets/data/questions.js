    description: `
      <p>
        FUSD has jacked up the land acquisition costs and the development costs to raise the school impact fees in 2017. Based on the SFNA reports starting from 2014 the 2017 the land and development costs does not justify the increase as compared to 2016.

    title: `Violation of Government code Section 65995.7 (a)(1). All new construction developer fees must be dropped to Level 2 with immediate effect`,
    description: `
    As per Government code Section 65995.7 (a)(1), “state funds are not available if the State Allocation
    Board is no longer approving apportionments for new construction pursuant to Article 5 (commencing with
    Section 17072.20) of Chapter 12.5 of Part 10 of the Education Code due to a lack of funds available for new
    construction. Upon making a determination that state funds are no longer available, the State Allocation Board
    shall notify the Secretary of the Senate and the Chief Clerk of the Assembly, in writing, of that determination
    and the date when state funds are no longer available for publication in the respective journal of each house.
    For the purposes of making this determination, the board shall not consider whether funds are available for, or
    whether it is making preliminary apportionments or final apportionments pursuant to, Article 11 (commencing
    with Section 17078.10).”
    <br><br>
    In one of the joint FUSD and Fremont city board meetings, it was announced that FUSD got update that
    now the funds are available for apportionments but FUSD will drop the developer fees to level 2 from level 3
    only after FUSD receives the first check. This seems to be violation of Government code Section 65995.7.
    <br><br>
    Please explain how the Government code allows FUSD charge Level 3 fess for new construction.
    <br><br>
    Note: Dublin school district has dropped the school impact fees to level 2 for brand new construction.

    Dublin school district are charging only $3.48 existing home addition more than 500 sq. ft.`,

    2017 SFNA report as compared to 2016. When this was raised to FUSD board, the board mentioned that there
    was a mistake in the previous SFNA reports and that was the reason for such an increase in 2017 SFNA
    report.
    <br><br>
    If the mistake was done by FUSD, which let the developers pay lass in the prior years why should the
    developers constructing now pay for it. If FUSD has collected the right amount of fees in the prior years, there
    would have been surplus amount offsetting the current developer fees. FUSD must find out other means for
    their mistake and not charge current developers higher cost.`,

    cost of land as per SFNA is $3.5 million per acre.
    <br><br>
    The value of this land to offset the cost must match the cost used to acquire additional land for the purpose of calculating the developer fees.

    COPs is not included to offset the impact of students generated from non-mitigated Future Units.
    The fair way to calculate is to include 32.86 acre to offset the cost at the rate of $3.5 million per acre but add
    the cost of COPs towards the developer fees.

    Why FUSD did not consider it doing in the in a fair way? Is it this done this way purposely to increase the
