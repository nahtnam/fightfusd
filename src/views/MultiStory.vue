              <br>
              Dear Council Members,
              <br>
              <br>
              I am a long-term resident of Fremont, and I see that the board is planning on restricting second story construction. Every new residential complex is multi-story because most people prefer having more than one floor. If people preferred single story homes, the builders would not be able to sell these multi-story ones. City council members who are elected by the people are trying to go against the needs of the majority of the people by favoring a few residents who are trying to bring up this restriction.
              <br>
              <br>
              I along with my family strongly disagree on limiting the second floor to 1000 sq. ft. in R1-6 zone. It should be allowed at least up to 1500 sq.ft. The proposals approved by the board on September 11, 2018, are too restrictive and not acceptable to the needs of most residents.
              <br>
              <br>
              The city council must put this on the upcoming election ballot so that the residents of Fremont can decide on their own rather than a select group of individuals.
              <br>
              <br>
              We will continue to support the council members who are aligned with our interests and will seek to replace any who are not.
              <br>
              <br>
              Sincerely,
              <br>
              Fremont Resident
              <br>
