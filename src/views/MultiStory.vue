          <li>

          <li>
            Alt 7-2: Even stricter. Total allowed (second floor + first floor) 45% of the lot AND second floor cannot exceed 30% of the first floor.

              Dear Council Members,
              <br>
              <br>
              I am a long-term resident of Fremont, and I see that the board is planning on restricting second story construction. Every new residential complex is multi-story because most people prefer having more than one floor. If people preferred single story homes, the builders would not be able to sell these multi-story ones. City council members who are elected by the people are trying to go against the needs of the majority of the people by favoring a few residents who are trying to bring up this restriction.
              <br>
              <br>
              I along with my family strongly disagree on placing a moratorium on the construction of two-story homes and second-story additions just because city council members are not able to come up with an agreeable proposal. I also strongly oppose both of the proposed alternative (Alt 3 and Alt 7-2) of restricting 2nd story constructions. These proposals are too restrictive and not acceptable to the needs of most residents.
              <br>
              <br>
              The city council must put this on the upcoming election ballot so that the residents of Fremont can decide on their own rather than a select group of individuals.
              <br>
              <br>
              We will continue to support the council members who are aligned with our interests and will seek to replace any who are not.
              <br>
              <br>
              Sincerely,
              <br>
              Fremont Resident
              <br>
